## Project Marking Guide

The final projects will be marked out of 100 points (later translated to % for grads/undergrads)

The approximate breakdown is as follows (however, it may vary depending on the style of the project): 
   * Project concept/idea and its development throughout the term:  40 points
   * Writing/presentation of the final report: 20 points
   * Linkages to related work (course or workshop readings, as well as other background works): 20 points
   * Methodology (appropriateness discussed, how it was executed, are limitations or alternatives considered): 20 points
   
   
As mentioned in class, the following criteria will be used when I provide marks: 
   * Quality of the project – idea, motivation, conceptualization, evaluation, future work revealed, potential impact to researchers, society etc.
   * Quality of the written reports, presentation
   * Does the presentation of the project demonstrate  “deep” knowledge of the concepts taught in the course (and in the readings/workshops), were you able to go beyond the core course content and find other relevant works/papers
   * You can expect grades according to the following:
      * A+:  Should be publishable in a workshop (or shows potential for).   
      * A or A-:  Project is at an excellent or very good level (all components are well treated)
      * B+ or B:  Meets expectations in terms of all components. 
      * B- or C:  Below expectations ine one or more ways
   * Note that individual students will be awarded grades that are prorated according to the effort they put into their project.  Some student grades may be lower or higher than the overall team grade.
      
      
Some hints:
   * Do take into the consideration, the feedback I gave you following the proposal and interim reports.   If you have questions, ask sooner rather than later.
   * The way the report is written is worth a certain percentage, BUT the writing can also impact other elements if they are not presented well.  Iterate on the report and make sure all members contribute to the writing and confirm it is coherent. 
   * Make sure each student clearly indicates their contributions to the projects (I'm not interesting in hearing I did a commit to the project, you need to describe what you did).
